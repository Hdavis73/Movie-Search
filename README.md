Movie Search
I built this website as a replica of a project I created for a client that I could include in my portfolio. This website on page load displays the top 20 movies for that
year which are looped into a slider from TMDB's movie api. Each tile shows the poster for the movie, and when clicked the background image of the video-player changes
to display a new background poster, and an info box displays the title, description, rating release date, and a 'find trailer' button for the selected move. The original
client project played a video trailer in the 'video-player' box (hence the name) and I was hoping to do the same thing for this one, but was unable to find an API that
had video links for movie trailers. I added a search bar that searches the API and changes the slider to display movies based off of the search. In the future, I would like
to find a way to implement a popup that saves a selected option to cookies.  The original project this is based off of included a popup, and a login function, but I do not 
think this particular project needs to have a login function.
